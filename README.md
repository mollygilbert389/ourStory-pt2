## Description

This application is a community writing experiment. Inspired by [Reddit Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnRCZK3KjUY) we wanted to achieve something with words. This app was created with React, Express, Node, Redux, Socket io, and Auth0. 

THIS SITE IS UNDER CONTRCUTION. This is a code refractor of the following project:
